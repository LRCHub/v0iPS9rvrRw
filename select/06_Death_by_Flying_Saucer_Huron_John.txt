(Never gonna love again)
(Hello, John)
(Never gonna...)

I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again 'cause of you, ooh
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again 'cause of you, ooh

I do love a night when no one really is on anything (Yeah)
Then I feel okay about my lack of plan, a diamond ring
For everybody who hate getting left on read as much as me (Haha!)
Solitude in my room is when I feel the most at ease, yeah
Bank account is empty from the clothing I cannot afford (Yeah)
But the answer to the formula is on my skating board (Yeah)
Then, I fall flat on my face
Then, I erase the text that I typed last night
You know I get erratic when I go out

(Never gonna love again)
I'm never gonna love again (Yeah)
I'm never gonna love again 'cause of you, ooh
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again 'cause of you, ooh

I can't be alone
I can't be alone
I can't be alone
I can't be alone (Haha!) no more
(Never gonna love again)
(Never gonna love again-gain-gain) (Yeah)

College be a waste of money but we all pay anyway (Yeah)
Do you reply honestly when people ask are you okay-hay?
I remember when we dropped, like, all our coin in Clash of Clans
My friend, he said, "Johnny, if you really can't
Open up your mind, then acid can"
I don't know if he was right, but we all pressured by our peer
Then, we played that Rainbow Road
And off the track I'm 'bout to steer, no (Yeah)

Off the track I'm 'bout to steer, yeah
(Never gonna love again) (Yeah)
Doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo

(Never gonna love again)
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again 'cause of you, ooh (Yeah, yeah)
I'm never gonna love again
(I'm never gonna love again) (Yeah, yeah)
I'm never gonna love again 'cause of you
(Yeah, yeah) (Never gonna love again) (Ohh)

Eighth grade, I would bump Wolf by Tyler
Feelin' so lost like I be Will Byers
Doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doo (Wait)
